# Project Overview
The deliverable for this assigment is an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Dashboard Features
- A dropdown menu is used to select a test subject ID
- Demographic information is displayed from the metadata JSON object
- A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu displays the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual by using the dropdown menu
- A bubble chart displays each sample
